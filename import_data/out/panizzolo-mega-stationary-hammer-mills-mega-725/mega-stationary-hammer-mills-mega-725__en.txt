Mega 725

Stationary recycling plant with hammer mill Designed for the flexible
grinding of heavy duty metal scrap.

Fields of application

The hammer mill can grind heavy duty metal scraps which cause
significant processing peaks. Some examples include: Electric motors up
to 40 kg, mixed metals, car engines, crankcases and mixed aluminium,
mixed metal scrap and still more.

Oscillating surface with eccentric

Specifically designed by Panizzolo to handle the infeed and outfeed
material and reduce vibrations to the machinery. The special system
evenly distributes material, appropriately checking and balancing the
material flow.

Reduction of environmental vibrations

40 vibration dampers are installed between the base and floor. They can
dampen about 80% of the vibrations produced by machining, thus
protecting structural quality and operator safety.

Electric panel: design and components

The Mega series includes a totally in-house designed electric panel.
This allows for the quality check of the components and their constant
upgrading. Specific energy analysers record processing data and dialogue
with the software. To protect the components against metal dust, the
panel is insulated and equipped with a filtering and temperature control
system of the inlet air.

Combinable accessories

Depending on production requirements, the machinery can quickly be
combined with a wide range of accessories and sorting systems.
