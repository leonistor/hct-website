# Kraken pre-shredders

The Kraken Series is designed for the volumetric reduction of high-impact scrap metal, offering a durable and technologically advanced solution. Each component is built to ensure operational continuity, reliability and full integration in modern industrial plants.

## Key strengths

#### High production performance

The Kraken series guarantees high production standards when processing complex scrap. The shredding logic, combined with a solid mechanical structure, allows large loads to be handled without interruption. Thanks to its perfect integration with Panizzolo hammer mills – particularly the MEGA models – the Kraken series helps maximise the performance of the entire plant.

#### Effective volumetric reduction

At the heart of the process and the result of advanced know-how, the in-house designed gear shafts are one of the distinguishing features of Kraken pre-shredders. Their configuration ensures precise and effective tearing, capable of reducing material in a single step, even when dealing with bulky or compact scrap.

#### Structural quality

Every construction detail is designed to successfully cope with even the most intensive applications: from the selection of certified framework to reinforced welds, and the use of components supplied by top Italian and Northern European companies. The design choices respond to a logic oriented towards the highest structural quality, which guarantees strength, durability and reliable long-term performance.

#### Simplified maintenance

The Kraken series is designed to be operational quickly and facilitate maintenance. The quick release system of the shafts from the gearboxes allows for agile and targeted interventions, while the internally designed bearing supports protect the mechanical components from dirt and contamination, preserving the operational efficiency of the machinery.

#### Fast and flexible configuration

The electrical panel and hydraulic power unit are located in dedicated containers, designed to facilitate transport, installation and start-up operations. A compact and functional solution that simplifies logistics management and optimises set-up time.

## Key strengths

#### Fields of application

The PSH Kraken 2300 is designed for shredding complex scrap such as whole cars and car bales even complete with engines and mechanical components, aluminium profiles, ferrous scrap, mixed and bulky scrap. The configuration of the shredding chamber and shafts allows large volumes to be handled continuously and accurately, maximising production performance.

#### Process safety and reliability

One of the added values of the PSH Kraken 2300 is its high effectiveness in protecting the treatment process. Thanks to its shredding logic, the machine also acts directly on potentially critical components such as cylinders or tanks, tearing them apart and releasing any residual gas or flammable liquids. This approach reduces the risk of damage or faults in subsequent stages and contributes to the overall safety and reliability of the plant.

#### Intelligent and flexible management

The closed-circuit hydraulic system, with variable displacement pumps and electronic control, allows torque and speed to be adjusted according to the material being processed. This allows a dynamic response to mechanical stresses and complete versatility in handling, as well as offering greater operational stability.

#### High-performance gearboxes

PSH Kraken 2300 incorporates planetary gearboxes dimensioned to withstand high loads and harsh working conditions. High performance is guaranteed by technology partners that are internationally recognised for the excellence of their quality standards.
