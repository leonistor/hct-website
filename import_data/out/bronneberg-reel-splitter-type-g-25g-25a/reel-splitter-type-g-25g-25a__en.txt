Bronneberg Reel Splitter Type G-25/G-25A

Our product range includes roll-cutting machines (sometimes referred to
as paper-roll cutters or reel splitters) for the recycling of roll
remainders from, for example, paper production, the packing industry,
print works, the textile industry etc. These heavy rolls cannot be
processed efficiently using the normal cutting equipment, but with our
special “Guillotine” roll cutters this problem is eliminated.
Our years of experience in the engineering of recycling machines have
enabled us to develop a paper-roll cutter that is calculated to give
years of trouble-free service in the recycling of paper rolls.
Various versions of the Bronneberg reel cutting machine are available.
The roll cutter is suitable for cutting paper, carton, plastic foil and
aluminum foil. Our range contains reel cutting machines for rolls up to
3,000 mm wide and maximum 1,200 mm in diameter.
Please contact our specialists for more information about cutting paper,
cardboard, plastic foil and aluminium foil. We have roll cutters in our
programme for rolls of up to 3000 mm wide and a maximum diameter of 1200
mm.
