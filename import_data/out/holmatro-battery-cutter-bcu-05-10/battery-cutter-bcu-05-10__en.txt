Battery Cutter BCU 05 A 10

The Holmatro Industrial Battery Cutter is ideal for low frequency use
when mobile our cutting tool is not the right fit for purpose! This
battery-powered cutter is specifically designed and equipped for
applications that require more freedom of movement or when cutting needs
to be performed in hard-to-reach places. It is also ideal for situations
where the cutter needs to be on standby for urgent use.

Like our Mobile cutters, our Industrial Battery cutters are constructed
from high-grade aluminum in combination with a steel plunger, resulting
in light tools. The battery pump is based on the proven lithium-ion
battery technology, that combines a long battery life with a high
capacity for maximum operational use.

The cutter ICU 05 A 10 is equipped with blades including blade guiding,
which makes it ideal for cable cutting.
