Stationary Cutter - 1 hand controlled ICU 20 S 10

Holmatro Industrial Stationary Cutters are specially designed for
continuous use in industrial processes where repetitive tasks are
performed at a fixed point e.g. a production line. This model
prioritizes durability, making it suitable for high load frequency
applications, and ergonomics to meet prolonged physical demands.

The ICU 20 S 10 is equipped with blades including blade guiding, which
makes it ideal for cable cutting.

Constructed entirely from high-grade steel, the Stationary Cutter
ensures robustness and reliability in its stationary setup. To address
the weight increase compared to portable aluminum models, a balancer is
incorporated to maintain ease of use and operator comfort.

With a strong commitment to safety, durability, and ergonomics,
Holmatro’s Industrial Cutting Tools stand out as reliable and
high-performance tools, meeting the diverse cutting needs of industrial,
heavy-duty applications while ensuring user comfort and safety
