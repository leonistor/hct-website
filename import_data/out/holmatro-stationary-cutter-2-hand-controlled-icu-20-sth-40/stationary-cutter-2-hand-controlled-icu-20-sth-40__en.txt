Holmatro Industrial Stationary Cutters are specially designed for
continuous use in industrial processes where repetitive tasks are
performed at a fixed point e.g. a production line. This model
prioritizes durability, making it suitable for high load frequency
applications, and ergonomics to meet prolonged physical demands.

The ICU 20 STH 40 is equipped with blades combing cutting & spreading
function, which makes it ideal recycling of house hold appliances like
refrigerators and heat pumps.

Constructed entirely from high-grade steel, the Stationary Cutter
ensures robustness and reliability in its stationary setup. To address
the weight increase compared to portable aluminum models, a balancer is
incorporated to maintain ease of use and operator comfort.
