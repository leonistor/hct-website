#### Fields of application

The hammer mill can grind and refine various types of medium-sized metal waste. Some examples include: electric motors, WEEE scrap, shred aluminium, tins, electric transformers, mixed metal scrap and more.

#### Base and transport

The plant is supplied ready for use, installed on a flatbed with autonomous hydraulic lift. The frame is designed by Panizzolo, reinforced and with excellent lengthwise stiffness. The pistons are welded and complete with swivel supports.

#### Grinding logic

The structure of the mill is designed to prevent the ejection of material from the inlet while wear is limited to armours, grilles and hammers. These are manufactured with the best steels and castings for gradual wear and keeping the quality of the ground scrap constant.

#### Rotor and hammers

The rotors facilitate grinding of mechanical scrap, absorbing stress without long-term structural repercussions. Panizzolo has eliminated the most common points of fragility by studying every element and designing specific components. Free rotary hammers are installed at 360Â°, structured to exploit the best ratio between impact strength and crushing capacity.

#### Structural solidity

The high quality of the components, steelwork and welds guarantee that the hammer mills remain intact over time and are able to crush heavy-duty scrap.

#### Easy maintenance

This implicates involving an essential number of operators, without the need for special equipment or highly professional competences.

Periodical control and greasing operations are designed to be simple and intuitive. The rotor can turn all the way thanks to the built-in double sheave.
