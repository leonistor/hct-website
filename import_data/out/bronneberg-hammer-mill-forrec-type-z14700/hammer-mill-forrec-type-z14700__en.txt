Hammer mill Forrec Type Z14/700

With the development of this unique hammer mill, Forrec offers you the
most advanced solution for the processing of various non-ferrous and
ferrous products. Whereas in the past huge investments were required,
this hammer mill offers you a unique option to start processing and
recovering valuable metals from products you were never able to process
before.
Certain products should be processed with a single or double shaft
shredder before entering the hammer mill. After this, the hammer mill
will further separate the material and will also densify it, in order to
create a higher value.
The Forrec hammer mill offers you the following advantages:
-   Enormous diversity in products that can be processed
-   Highest recovery rates of valuable metals from your material streams
-   Maximum density of output fraction
-   Low maintenance and running costs
