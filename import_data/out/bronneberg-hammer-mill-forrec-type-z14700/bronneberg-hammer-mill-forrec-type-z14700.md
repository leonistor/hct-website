## General information

With the development of this unique hammer mill, Forrec offers you the most advanced solution for the processing of various non-ferrous and ferrous products. Whereas in the past huge investments were required, this hammer mill offers you a unique option to start processing and recovering valuable metals from products you were never able to process before.

Certain products should be processed with a single or double shaft shredder before entering the hammer mill. After this, the hammer mill will further separate the material and will also densify it, in order to create a higher value.

The Forrec hammer mill offers you the following advantages:

- Enormous diversity in products that can be processed
- Highest recovery rates of valuable metals from your material streams
- Maximum density of output fraction
- Low maintenance and running costs
