### Grinding patents

A common characteristic of Panizzolo hammer mills, the interchangeable cradle is a significant plus in the grinding of metal scrap

#### Grinding logic

The structure of the mill is designed to prevent the ejection of material from the inlet while wear is limited to armours, grilles and hammers. These items are manufactured with the best steels and castings for gradual wear and keeping the quality of the ground scrap constant.

#### Low energy costs

The hammer mill maximises the ratio between energy consumption and hourly productivity. The line includes models from 110 kW to 315 kW, with production performance from 4.5 ton/h to 15 ton/h depending on the machinery.

#### Low management costs

The machinery is designed to minimise production downtime and the number of operators involved in the operation. The software autonomously monitors and adjusts the treatment, so that personnel do not need to be constantly near the plant.

#### Rotor and hammers

The rotors facilitate grinding of scrap, absorbing stress without long-term structural repercussions. Panizzolo has eliminated the most common points of fragility by studying every element and designing specific components. Hammers are installed they can rotate freely 360°. They are designed for an ideal crushing capacity without being subject to long-term warping, breakage or cracks.

#### Easy maintenance

These periodical operations require an essential number of operators, without the need for special equipment or highly professional competences. The rotor can turn all the way thanks to the built-in double sheave. Controls and greasing are designed to be simple and intuitive.

“Flex” hammer mills are designed for the grinding and initial sorting of a vast type of metal scraps. The machinery includes as per standard: load conveyor belt, oscillating load and unload system, hammer mills with rotor and patented cradle, base with vibration dampers, magnetic drum, walkways, access ladders, electric panel with supervision software, electric and hydraulic circuit and safety and monitoring systems of the process.

Panizzolo hammer mills allow full access to the grinding chamber where one can effectively intervene on the cradle, rotor, grilles, hammers and armours. All these details make a difference in reducing any machine downtime. Consistent with our quality policy, Panizzolo designs almost all of the components and uses components coming from Italian or North European suppliers known for top quality in the sector.
