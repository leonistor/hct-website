Flex 1000

Stationary recycling plant with hammer mill Designed for the flexible
grinding of metal scrap.

Fields of application

The hammer mill can grind and refine various types of medium-sized metal
waste. Some examples include: small transformers, small electric motors,
WEEE scrap, shred aluminium, tins, SUW waste, mixed ferrous metals and
still more.

Oscillating surface with eccentric

Specifically designed by Panizzolo to handle the infeed and outfeed
material and reduce vibrations to the machinery. The special system
evenly distributes material, appropriately checking and balancing the
material flow.

Reduction of environmental vibrations

24 vibration dampers are installed between the base and floor. They can
dampen about 80% of the vibrations produced by machining, thus
protecting structural quality and operator safety.

Electric panel: design and components

The Flex series includes a totally in-house designed electric panel.
This allows for the quality check of the components and their constant
upgrading. Specific energy analysers record processing data and dialogue
with the software. To protect the components against metal dust, the
panel is insulated and equipped with a filtering and temperature control
system of the inlet air.

Combinable accessories

Depending on production requirements, the machinery can quickly be
combined with a wide range of accessories and sorting systems.
