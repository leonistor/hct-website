# Industrial shredders

The double shaft industrial shredders of the PZ and OP lines are metal waste crushing plants, designed to shred and effectively reduce the volumes of bulky waste, mixed waste, metal scrap, MSW and large quantities of industrial waste. Their effectiveness is confirmed by the many companies in the industry using them to **shred paper mill pulper**, **copper**, **aluminium**, **electric cables** and **electric motors**, and dispose of **WEEE** and **tyres**.

The design advantages of our **industrial shredders** concern the quality of the alloys that the screwed sector and standard integral blades of the **shredder** are made of, that are specially selected to guarantee long service life for **waste disposal** process components. Furthermore, the cutting chamber has been designed in such a way as to ensure easy, quick replacement of worn components. Panizzolo Recycling’s **waste shredding machines** are equipped with hydraulically or electrically driven power transmission units. The base and loading hopper are available in various sizes depending on the material to be processed and the processing logistic choices.

Thanks to simple, intuitive control software, the operator can safely and independently monitor all processing stages. Finally, the high production yield, lower costs and high quality of output materials mean our range of **industrial** **shredders** have very high performance. Output materials are optimally suited to be transported and transferred to **bulky waste recycling** and refining plants. Panizzolo Recycling offers a wide range of **bulky waste shredders**, able to support all companies in the waste management system. Our **shredders** are divided into **shredding systems for scrap**, **shredding systems for waste**, **opener** systems and **tearing** machinery.

#### Metal scrap shredders

#### Hydraulic circuit

Panizzolo Recycling’s **two-shaft shredders** are innovative solutions developed specifically to support all companies in **metal** and ferrous **scrap shredding**. Thanks to their high technical and manufacturing advantages, these **scrap shredders** are considered by industry operators to be reliable, durable and highly performing machines, with long service lives.
