# Deep learning, real-time monitoring and more: The recycling trends for 2025 according to TOMRA 

[https://www.tomra.com/waste-metal-recycling/media-center/news/2025/2025-trends](https://www.tomra.com/waste-metal-recycling/media-center/news/2025/2025-trends)

As we embark on a new year, a pressing question arises: What are the defining trends that will shape the future of our industry? Dr. Volker Rehrmann, EVP and Head of TOMRA Recycling, a global leader in sensor-based sorting solutions, provides valuable insights into the key trends in sorting and recycling.

## 1. Deep learning

Deep learning will continue to shape the recycling industry in 2025. This subset of artificial intelligence (AI) achieved significant milestones in sorting last year, such as separating food-grade and non-food-grade plastics. Deep learning is poised to tackle increasingly complex sorting tasks and expand into new segments, such as metal sorting, unlocking new levels of efficiency and sustainability in the recycling industry.

Traditional systems, which remain critical due to decades of refinement, focus on sorting by material type (NIR sensors) or color (VIS sensors). Deep learning's value lies in object recognition using full-color cameras which recognise the types of objects based on shape, size, dimensions and more. Systems like TOMRA's GAINnext™ use deep learning to mimic human vision and can be precisely trained to automate sorting challenges previously undertaken manually. 

Deep Learning systems mimic human vision using full-color cameras and will further make their way into our industry in 2025.

## 2. Real-time monitoring


In 2025, advanced AI and cloud technologies will be increasingly utilized for waste analysis, enhancing transparency in sorting facilities. Platforms like TOMRA Insight collect data directly from sorting systems, while tools like PolyPerception’s waste analyzer use cameras for real-time waste monitoring and classification at key sorting points.

Digital twins of sorting lines allow detailed object tracking and analysis. These systems enable operators and recyclers to make data-driven decisions to improve output quality, prevent material loss and preempt potential disruptions. The benefits include enhanced efficiency and compliance with regulatory standards.

## 3. European Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR)

The European Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) will be a critical focus in 2025 due to its far-reaching impact on the industry.

With the 2030 target of 70% recyclability for all packaging looming, companies must urgently adapt to strict requirements for recyclability and robust infrastructure. The PPWR mandates that plastic packaging must contain a minimum of 10-35% recycled content by 2030 -- depending on the type of plastic and its intended use -- with higher targets set for 2040.

These targets will drive innovations in eco-design and recycling technologies, including advanced mechanical recycling and chemical recycling.

The PPWR provides the industry with planning certainty and encourages investment, particularly in recycled content demand for plastics, potentially helping to stabilize prices for recycled materials. Positive developments in this regard may emerge as early as this year. 


## 4. Decarbonization: aluminum recycling

Decarbonization will remain a priority in 2025, particularly in the aluminum sector. Many large companies are committed to net-zero targets, driving demand for recycled aluminum and high-quality feedstock.

Using recycled aluminum yields significant CO2 savings compared to other materials. Achieving 'green' aluminum requires increased aluminum sorting and greater granularity, such as separating aluminum alloys (1xxx, 3xxx, 5xxx or 6xxx series) into high-purity fractions. LIBS (Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) technology remains groundbreaking in this area, and TOMRA plans to install several AUTOSORT™ PULSE systems globally in 2025. 

## 5. Focus on lesser-known material streams
While recycling plastics, organic waste and aluminum is well-established, the recycling of other material streams are still in their infancy and will gain attention in 2025.

For example, wood sorting technologies now enable the production of recycled materials matching the quality of virgin raw materials. Processed and unprocessed wood can be separated and medium-density fiberboard recovered efficiently. This year could see these solutions implemented on an industrial scale. Similarly, advancements in textile recycling are poised to showcase what’s technologically feasible, paving the way for larger-scale adoption.

From innovative sorting technologies to regulatory-driven changes, 2025 promises to be a transformative year for the recycling industry!
