The European recycling industry is facing significant challenges, including a wave of plastic recycling plant closures due to high energy costs, economic pressure, and cheap imports. This has led to a projected loss of nearly one million tonnes of plastic recycling capacity by the end of 2025. However, recent data shows a decrease in overall plastic packaging waste and some countries, like Belgium and Latvia, have achieved high plastic recycling rates, with more countries nearing 2030 targets. 
Industry challenges

- **Plant closures**: A significant number of plastic recycling plants are closing, driven by low-priced imported recyclates that are cheaper than European-made products.
- **Economic pressure**: High energy and labor costs are exacerbating economic pressures on European recyclers.
- **Capacity loss**: The closures are leading to a loss of nearly one million tonnes of recycling capacity since 2023, with forecasts indicating zero net growth in 2025 for the first time in years.
- **Impact**: The industry is at a "breaking point," with fears that the EU will become more dependent on unsustainable imports and a growing waste problem.
- **Permitting hurdles**: High costs and excessive red tape are also contributing factors. 

## Positive developments and data

- **Decreasing plastic waste**: Overall plastic packaging waste decreased in the EU in 2023.

### Higher recycling rates

- **Top performers**: Belgium (59.5%) and Latvia (59.2%) recorded the highest plastic recycling rates.
- **Meeting targets**: Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Czechia, Slovenia, Slovakia, and Spain recycled over 70% of their packaging waste in 2023, already meeting the 2030 target.
- **Deposit-return systems**: The implementation of deposit-return systems in more countries is expected to increase bottle collection rates and improve feedstock quality in the coming years.
- **Innovation**: There is ongoing innovation, such as the development of new methods for recycling rare earths that cut down on toxic waste. 

## Industry response

- **Call for action**: Industry bodies like Plastics Recyclers Europe (PRE) are urging decisive political action to restore the sector's competitiveness.
- **Proposed solutions**: They recommend removing permitting obstacles, providing access to affordable energy, and reducing red tape.
